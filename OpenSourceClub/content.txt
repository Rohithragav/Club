Open Source Club At VIT University, Chennai is a Student Collaboration for using freely distributed source and the communications infrastructure of the Internet. Our Club boosts software for which the source code is distributed without charge or limitations on modifications. We extends this ideology that software’s are better when they are free and gives users the freedom to cooperate with each other, to lead an upright life. 
We strongly believe that open source is the future of technology and that it’s important to incorporate the open source way into learning teaching and partnering. Learning and teaching "the open source way" will better prepare students for their careers, while helping schools differentiate themselves and growing the next generation of open source contributors.
